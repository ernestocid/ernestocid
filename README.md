## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer scientist/software engineer living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In the past I did research on software testing and verification and got a PhD on systems and computing. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Loggi, a brazilian unicorn that is improving logistics through technology. Nowadays I'm part of the infrastrucutre team, working on data pipelines and cool improvements in our platform.
